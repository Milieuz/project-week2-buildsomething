# Weather App, API Fetching

## Brief Description:
- This is a simple website that fetches data from an API based on the zipcode supplied by the user. The website will then return the (1) location, (2) Temp in F and C, (3) the curernt 'condition'.

## Why I Chose This Project:
- I wanted to refamiliarize myself with a simple webiste that utilizes all parts of a modern website (HTML, CSS, and JS).

## Upgrades/Future Changes
- This API will fetch quite a bit of information, only some of which is rendered here. Further possibilites of data include: 14 day forecast, historical weather, time zone, air quality, wind, etc.
- Formatting and style could definitely use an overhaul.
- This website could be utilized personally, as I check the daily weather or integrate this into a personal homepage.
